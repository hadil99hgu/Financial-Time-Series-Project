## Financial time series analysis
Attached we have a file containing tradeables (investable time series) 
The aime of this project is to respond to these questions:
Could you please explain to me in which one(s), if any, you would recommend investing based on these data alone?
In case you could gather more/alternative data, what would your top priorities please be?
